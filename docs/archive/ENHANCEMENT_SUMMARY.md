- Absolute values/norms: `|∇u|^p`
- Differential operators: `−Δu`, `∇u`
- Exponents: `^p`, `^{n+1}`

**Files Updated:**
- `js/content.js` - Enhanced `looksLikeMath()` function with 8 new patterns

### 3. **Intelligent AI Prompting** ✅
**Enhanced OpenAI prompt to handle:**
- Single symbols → Concise definitions
- Expressions → What they represent
- Equations → Mathematical significance  
- Multiple equations → Overall concepts

**Files Updated:**
- `backend/server.js` - Completely rewritten system prompt
- Increased `max_tokens` from 200 to 300 for longer explanations

### 4. **Improved Tooltip Display** ✅
**Enhanced for longer content:**
- Increased max-width: 400px → 500px
- Added max-height: 400px with scrolling
- Better responsive design for mobile
- Proper text wrapping for long explanations

**Files Updated:**
- `css/tooltip.css` - Enhanced sizing and scrolling

### 5. **Testing Infrastructure** ✅
**Created comprehensive test page:**
- `test-enhanced-highlighting.html` - 6 different test scenarios
- Tests single symbols, expressions, equations, and paragraphs
- Visual feedback and success criteria

## 🎯 NEW CAPABILITIES

### Before Enhancement:
```
User highlights: "∫"
Extension: "The integral symbol represents..."
```

### After Enhancement:
```
User highlights: "−Δu = |∇u|^p, x ∈ ℝⁿ₊"
Extension: "This is a p-Laplacian equation from nonlinear PDE theory. 
The −Δu term is the negative Laplacian operator, |∇u|^p creates 
a nonlinear gradient term with power p, and the domain constraint 
x ∈ ℝⁿ₊ indicates we're working in the positive orthant of n-dimensional 
real space. This type of equation appears in fluid mechanics, 
image processing, and mathematical biology..."

## 📊 ENHANCED VALUE PROPOSITION

### **New Tagline:**
```
"Highlight any math content - from single symbols to entire equations - 
for instant AI explanations in context"
```

### **Updated Store Description:**
```
Math Notation AI makes learning mathematics easier by providing instant, 
AI-powered explanations for any mathematical content you encounter online.

✨ FLEXIBLE HIGHLIGHTING:
• Single Symbol: Highlight "∫" to learn about integrals
• Expression: Highlight "∇u" to understand gradients  
• Full Equation: Highlight "−Δu = |∇u|^p" for complete explanation
• Multiple Equations: Highlight entire paragraphs for comprehensive context

🎯 INTELLIGENT & CONTEXT-AWARE:
• Understands surrounding text for accurate explanations
• Recognizes whether you want a quick definition or detailed analysis
• Explains what field the math belongs to (calculus, linear algebra, etc.)
• Adapts explanation depth to the amount of text highlighted

Perfect for students, researchers, and engineers reading:
• ArXiv papers with complex PDEs
• Calculus textbooks with unfamiliar notation
• Research papers with domain-specific symbols
• Technical documentation with mathematical expressions
```

## 📈 MARKETING POSITIONING

### **Reddit Posts:**
```
"Built an AI extension that explains entire math equations in context - 
not just individual symbols! 

Try highlighting '−Δu = |∇u|^p' and get a full explanation of 
p-Laplacian PDEs, what field it's from, and why it matters.

Game-changer for reading research papers! 🚀"
```

### **Twitter/X:**
```
🧮 Just enhanced my Math Notation AI extension!

Now you can highlight ENTIRE equations for context-aware explanations:

Single symbol: "∫" → "integral represents area under curve"
Full equation: "−Δu = |∇u|^p" → "p-Laplacian PDE from nonlinear analysis..."
