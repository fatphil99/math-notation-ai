# 🚀 Upload to GitHub - Step by Step

## ✅ What's Already Done:

- Git repository initialized
- All files staged and committed
- **Your .env file is NOT included** (secure! ✅)
- Ready to push to GitHub

---

## 📝 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `math-notation-ai`
   - **Description**: "Chrome extension for instant AI-powered math explanations"
   - **Visibility**: Choose one:
     - ✅ **Public** - Anyone can see it (recommended for portfolio)
     - 🔒 **Private** - Only you can see it (if you prefer)
3. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

---

## 🔗 Step 2: Connect and Push

GitHub will show you commands. Use these instead (already configured):

### A. Add GitHub as remote:

```bash
cd "/Users/philipshin/Desktop/Chrome Extensions/math notation ai"

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/math-notation-ai.git
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username!**

### B. Push to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

You'll be prompted for:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password**: Use a Personal Access Token (not your password!)

### How to Get a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "Math Notation AI Upload"
4. Select scopes: ✅ `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

---

## 🎉 Step 3: Verify

After pushing, go to:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/math-notation-ai
```

You should see:
- ✅ All your files
- ✅ README.md displayed
- ✅ **No .env file** (secure!)

---

## 🔒 Security Checklist

Before pushing, verify:

- [ ] `.env` is in `.gitignore` ✅ (already done)
- [ ] No API keys in code ✅ (already done)
- [ ] `backend/.env.example` exists (template for others) ✅
- [ ] All sensitive data excluded ✅

**Your actual `.env` file with API keys is safe and NOT uploaded!**

---

## 🚨 If You Accidentally Pushed .env

If you made a mistake and pushed your .env file:

1. **Immediately** rotate all your API keys:
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Stripe: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
   - MongoDB: Change password

2. Remove from git history:
```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch backend/.env" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

git push origin --force --all
```

3. Update all your keys in a new `.env` file
